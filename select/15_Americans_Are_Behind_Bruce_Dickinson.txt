Hello!

Well I've studied greenwich meantime
And its different from cet
But in europe we're all in line
And that's no big problem for me, ha, ha
But over in the USA
While we're all having our tea
They're maybe just getting dressed,
Well that's no way to be.

Americans are behind
Americans are behind
Americans are behind
Americans are behind

Well I called them on the telephone
During office hours
I'd spoken to their answerphone,
Some silly mumbling cow
She said "iIm sorry we're not open yet but have a nice day"
But it's gone noon,
They're still in bed
They're far behind in the UAS

Americans are behind
Americans are behind
Americans are behind
Americans are behind

Good lord, can't you hurry up
Americans are behind
Americans, get a move on now!

At the third stroke
We will all have a jolly good time...

Precisely...
